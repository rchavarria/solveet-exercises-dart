# solveet-exercises-dart

A set of solutions to [Solveet] exercises writen in the Dart programming language.

## Project structure

Tests for every exercise can be found under the `test` folder separated in their
own folder. The implementation of every solution can be found under the `bin`
folder, at the same level of the corresponding test.

To run all tests, execute the command: `dart test/all_tests.dart`. To run a
specific test, execute: `dart test/<exercise>/<exercise>.dart`.

## Exercises
